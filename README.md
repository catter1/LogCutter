# LogCutter

This is a very simple datapack that adds some new Stonecutter recipes for the logs! Now, all logs, woods, stems, and hyphae have stonecutter recipes to turn into their stripped version, and vice versa.

Just to be specific, the datapack supports these wood types:
- Oak
- Spruce
- Birch
- Jungle
- Acacia
- Dark Oak
- Mangrove
- Crimson
- Warped
- Cherry (1.20)
- Bamboo (1.20)
...which work for both their log/stem and wood/hyphae variants.

That's all. Enjoy easier stripping, and being able to undo a stripping mistake!
